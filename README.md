Observations and InsightsÂ¶

1.The strong positive correlational coefficent of 0.8419 for Mouse weight to tumor volume indicates that heavier mice are likely to have a larger tumor volume.

2.A box plot of the 4 different drug treaments indicated that Capomulin and Ramicane appear to be the 2 best treatment options and more effective than Infubinol and Ceftamin.

3.Capomulin appears to have significantly decreased the overall tumor volume of the chosen mouse b128 over time, however, tumor volume did slightly increase again around the 40 point time marker.
